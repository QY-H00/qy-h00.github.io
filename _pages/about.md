I'm a second-year PhD student in the School of Computing at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by Professor [Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). Prior to this, I received my Honours Bachelor's degree with Highest Distinction, majoring in Computer Science from the same faculty.

My research focuses on enhancing the controllability and our understanding of deep learning models, particularly in how they manage and interpret data. I am currently engaged in several projects:

- Applying discrete diffusion to multimodal generation
- Developing an efficient and scalable video tokenizer
- Designing an adaptive solver for flow-matching

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:qhe@u.nus.edu) if you are interested in collaboration.
